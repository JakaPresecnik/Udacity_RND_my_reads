# MyReads Project

In the app we create our own library. We have 3 different shelfs, and we can switch between them. We also can search for new books and add them to our desired shelf.

## How to Use

To get started developing right away:

* clone the project and cd into the folder
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## About

Project was created for Udacity's React nanodegree. Initial starter file can be found on init_branch, although it is updated, because when I cloned the starter files it had vulnerabilities and I had to remove them.
